# pwdtools
A simple program for creating passwords and tools for working with them.


An improved version of the password generator from my other repository (https://github.com/Sur3n0s/PasswordGenerator)

Changes:

<li>Caesar's Cipher added</li>
<li>Cleaned the code</li>
<li>Changed font to Monospace</li>
<li>Added exe-file for Windows users</li>

I tried to make everything clear and beautiful. In the future I plan to refine this program, and also to style it differently. I would be grateful for your support.

#Installation

For linux users:
<i>pip install -r requirements.txt</i>
(From the cloned directory with the file "rquirements.txt")
Running the program:
<i>python3 pwdtools.py</i>

For Windows users:
Just run the exe file
But if you prefer to run the program through the command line, then you must have python3+ installed.
To do this, you need to install the pyqt5 package:
<i>pip install pyqt5</i>
or
<i>pip install -r requirements.txt</i>
(From the cloned directory with the file "rquirements.txt")
After that, simply run:
<i>python pwdtools.py</i>
